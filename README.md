Game-jam-Fixed-Code
This was the code from our 2021 Game jam game. The original code so I have slowly tried to clean up the code.

I have since tried to clean up teh teams orginal rushed code and make it more suited for modular coding and test and refine my AI coding skills.

It was super rough and not refined, reguardless I learned a lot as a leader and a developer.

I strongly feel every dev should write a post mortem so bellow is my post mortem.

2021 Game Jam Post Mortem.

In 2021 I decided to put a team together and make a game for the month-long GitHub competition. So, I went to my local college and searched for Computer Science students to join in. I was full of hope and optimism, but it quickly turned into one of the hardest and most rewarding challenges I have ever done. Through it all despite the failure and setbacks. I grew a lot as a person, leader, and a developer. I learned what went wrong, what to avoid, and lastly what to do to have a succesful game jam.

First off, what went wrong portion. The first and best advice I have. Is find people you enjoy working with and work well with. People make all the difference. The drama and the people aspect are so crucial to the project element of the game. Its worth it to invest in people who are going to help and encourage you and not cause drama or not communicate. If you plan on taking this solo of course none of this would apply, but if you’re working with a team or school event like we did. Be somewhat selective with people join and if you have 20-30 sign up expect 4 to work on the project.

Next thing that went wrong was leadership the bigger the group the more critical this becomes. With out leadership and clear vision, all you have is a group of people make what they think the game should look like. If you are the leader, lead its your vision. Tell people what they can do better and guide. A good leader leads be example. Kindly guide other and handle conflicts with people. If you don’t like an idea share that and give people changes to make it fit your vision. Most important a leader should communicate effectively down the chain of command, make sure people know what their vision is and how to create it.

Lastly on the topic of what went wrong is put the effort to make sure your code as modular and as easy to understand. If your cramming last minute to get the project done and you get to your buddy’s code and you spend time to debug and learn what it does and it’s not super intuitive and easy to understand. Then it can be a huge time waster. If your code requires you to explain everything it’s not good code. Nothing is more frustrating then rushing last minute on a build to get finished before a deadline just to get met by avoidable roadblocks. Make your code simple and modular movement does X nothing else. No huge scripts with everything the player does. “Movement” one script, “pick up item” should be another. Make things modular and simple. It will help a ton.

Now onto what to avoid, I would strongly avoid scope creep and outsider ideas. People like to come by tell you what to do give you crazy ideas. Avoid these people and just focus on what you think you can make. You’ll have plenty of dreamers come tell you crazy things. Don’t fall for it stay focus on building something within reason and manageable no need to stretch your self more then you ours. Even if someone tells you a cool idea and it fits the gameplay, right it down and save it for if you have the time.

Now some advice for how to be successful. Number one advice is to be comfortable with your game engine of choice and use tool to help with productivity such as GitHub, and Trello. Be comfortable with these tools and make sure your team has some knowledge of them as well. It’ll make everything run smoother. Trello have each person job and current task clearly listed and assigned. GitHub will keep all your code in branches, so you don’t break the main project, it is a wonderful robust tool, but you got to understand it and make sure your team does as well. As a side note with GitHub make sure you include what packages you plan on using if you use unity and your teammate is working on lighting and add a render pipeline, you need to include it in the main or it may break things when merging branches. You make a script or a scene in X branch merge it and test it with your local main. Always make sure your project works with the main branch. If your branch added X library or packages make sure to leave a note and add it too main. The last thing you want is last minute trying to remember what exactly you need to make the light work and how exactly did I do it on my branch. Just take good notes when you install a package or library and update the main with it.

My final word of advice to a successful game jam is keep things organized. Some people say oh just if it works your good. That is true if your solo and it’s a one-day event game jam. With a team and for a month-long event. Make sure things our neat. Especially if people our going to be working on it after your done with it. It saves time down the road to just keep things tidy and well oiled. Then needing to explain it multiple times to different people while your busy making something else.

That is my overall thoughts and advice from my experience of the 2021 game jam. Hopefully it can avoid a lot of headaches and wasted time. Overall, this has been a great learning and growing experience.
